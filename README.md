What is Coroutines ?
To understand that, first we need to get some background knowledge about functions and threads.
Function is a sequence of instructions that takes and give us outputs.
A Thread describes in which context this sequence of instructions should be executed.
Generally, a program will be executed one after another. means next line code never executed until previous code is done executed.
What distinguishes Coroutines from Threads ?
* Executed within a thread
* Coroutines are suspendable
* They can switch their context
So actually coroutines is lightweight with some useful extra functionality.
